#rBMC - relaxed Bounded Model Checking
rBMC is a tool for verifying a list of assembly programs under relaxed memory models. 
The tool adopts a bounded model checking approach to deal with the loop occuring in assembly source code

#Supported Memory Models
This work adopts a framework provided by Characholoo. The current support memory models are:
- SC
- TSO
- PSO

#Usage
